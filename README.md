## 🛠️ Tech stack

**What I used to build it:**
- **HTML5** — the structure of the page.
- **CSS3 with Flexbox** — for a clean, modern, and responsive layout.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — to handle all the stopwatch logic.
- **[Anime.js](https://animejs.com/)** — to add high-performance, easy-to-use animations.

## 💡 Why I made this

I built this project to practice core JavaScript skills and see how much more engaging a simple stopwatch can feel with a few thoughtful animations.  
It’s a fun little reminder that small touches — like bounce effects or button pulses — can really bring a frontend project to life.
